This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.
Based on the current state of the project, here are the key areas for future development:

1. Backend and Data:

Dynamic Data: The components currently use hardcoded placeholder content (e.g., in CategoryCard, ServiceCard, TestimonialCard). The next step is to replace this with dynamic data fetched from a backend API.
Database: A database is needed to store information about users, vendors, services, categories, and testimonials.
API Development: A backend API needs to be created to handle data management (create, read, update, delete operations) for all the application's features.
2. Features and Functionality:

Vendor System: Implement the "Become a Vendor" functionality, allowing vendors to register, create profiles, and list their services.
Service Details: Create individual pages for each service, accessible through the "View Service Details" buttons.
User Authentication: Allow users to sign up, log in, and manage their profiles.
Booking/Contact System: Implement a system for users to book services or contact vendors.
Search and Filtering: Add functionality to search for services and vendors, and to filter results by category, location, price, etc.
3. Content:

Real Images and Text: Replace all placeholder images and text with actual content for the services, categories, and testimonials.
